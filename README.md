# flow-demo

Current version: 0.2.0-alfa

`flow` is a special flavor of git-flow that is designed under the principal that all repos ought to
support multiple versions. Repos using `flow` enforce a tool-assisted version control that balances
ease-of-use with standardization.

This repo is a first attempt at a proof-of-concept for this system. It is being created before the
aforementioned tools, so there's a chance there could be a violation of the `flow` specification. If
once is noticed, it's very likely we're start from scratch.
